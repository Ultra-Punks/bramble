# Bramble

Project Description:

Bramble is a social media site that allows users to meet new friends, explore new communities and discover interesting activities in their neighborhood. The site features an interactive map that allows users to upload & review locations. The map dynamically changes as users navigate between different components throughout the site. Users can also subscribe to like-minded communities, interact with posts and comments and create reviews of locations they have visited. The site also leverages Google Cloud Vision for image recognition that provides unique tags associated with photos uploaded and posted by users.
